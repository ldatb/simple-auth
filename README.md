# Simple Auth

This project is a demonstration of a simple authentication system.

Don't take this seriously, when I made this, I just wanted to test stuff on Flask.

## Installation

### Dependencies

I use Pipenv to manage dependencies as it's the easiest in my opinion,
but feel free to use anything you want.

```bash
pipenv shell
pipenv sync
```

To run the API, simply use `python api/api.py`
